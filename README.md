# AMANCOM Lines System

## 1. Introduction

The company specializes in selling GPS tracking devices and offering integrated services associated with these devices. These GPS devices allow companies and individuals to monitor their vehicles' movements in real-time, enhancing safety and fleet management efficiency. Additionally, the company provides server subscription services for device connectivity and SIM cards tailored to both individual and commercial customer needs.

## 2. Problem Statement

The company faces several operational challenges, including:

1. **Manual customer and sales data management**:
   - The company handles diverse customer details, including contact info, purchased devices, and subscriptions. Managing this data manually is prone to errors and loss.

2. **Tracking SIM card status**:
   - With many SIM cards in stock, tracking their status (whether sold or unsold) manually is labor-intensive, risking loss or misuse.

3. **Managing server subscriptions**:
   - Monitoring server subscriptions, including duration, connected devices, and prices, is complex without a centralized system.

4. **Payment management**:
   - With various payment methods (Visa, bank transfers, Vodafone Cash), there's a need for an organized system to store payment proofs.

5. **Stock reporting**:
   - The company needs accurate reporting on SIM card stock levels to prevent issues with sudden depletion or data conflicts.

## 3. Objectives

The system aims to address these challenges by achieving the following goals:

1. **Centralized customer data management**:
   - Accurately record details of both individual and corporate customers.
   - Ensure each customer has a unique ID to avoid conflicts.

2. **Improved inventory management**:
   - Track SIM card status (sold/unsold).
   - Generate reports on SIM card sales and stock.

3. **Streamlined server subscription management**:
   - Facilitate the connection between devices and servers.
   - Track subscription details such as duration, price, and connected devices.

4. **Accurate financial reporting**:
   - Monitor all payment methods and store proof of payments (e.g., transfer screenshots, Vodafone Cash numbers).

5. **Simplified sales and operational management**:
   - Record sales details for devices and SIM cards.
   - Track sale dates and product status.

6. **Increased efficiency and reduced errors**:
   - Develop an integrated system to reduce manual data entry and minimize errors and data loss.

## 4. Conclusion

The system is designed to streamline the company's operations, ensuring better data management, improved efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction and trust.
